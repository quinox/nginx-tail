# TODO

* Remove smol in favour of their respective crates? To speed up compilation
* support updating the stats faster than the logs
* Remove unwraps where possible
* use io_uring for async file access?
* A 'total' line when there are lots of group lines
* Support reading from stdin
* CI
* Split `--filter` into `--include` and `--exclude`
